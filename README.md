### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Premanand S, a Researcher / Teacher by profession. I love to teach and also love to learn a lot of knowledge, especially in the Data Science domain. Lastly a complete FAMILY man. 

**About my experience,**

* I have experience of about 7+ years in the teaching domain as an Assistant Professor

* I have good experience in the R&D domain also

* Most importantly, as years pass on, I am gaining patience and thirst to learn new things again w.r.t Data Science and now C programming language!

**About my graduates,**

* Currently pursuing my PhD in the field of Biomedical Signal Processing

* Completed my Post Graduate in Power Electronics in Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai

* Completed my Under Graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore

* Degree is just for society, but have an intention to learn new things to crack something new to the society (sounds weird and usual but its my intention)

**About my interest,**

I have an addiction to learning Statistics (not again after schooling but to Data Science), Machine Learning and Python; you can ask me about Deep Learning. (Ans: It is in process) 

**About my hobbies,**

* YouTuber (Occasionally) 

* Scribbling (in Tamil, call it KIRUKKAL) 

* Drawing with my BHUBHUs

* Exploring new things like learning from our society what to do and what not to do? (looks silly, but many don't have this habit)

* Cooking (sometimes feedback makes me think budding chef too) 

* last but not least, music lovers (especially OSTs or, locally we call it BGMs). ThalaivARR Veriyan and Hanz Zimmer  

and lastly, driving out with my family

**About my goal/ambition / Wish (Aasai),**

* Special word before my name - "Dr."

* One unique book with good recognition in Data Science related

* Good teacher

* Abroad visit exclusively for education-related, excluding family trips that's another goal

* One lovely house with one car

* lastly, a good father and a good family man to be happy and to make happy
